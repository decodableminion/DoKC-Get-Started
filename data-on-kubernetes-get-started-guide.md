# Data on Kubernetes - Getting Started Guide

Contributors: Paul Au, 

## Project Description
The barrier to entry for any technology and community surrounding that technology can often be quite high. The purpose of this document is to capture existing resources that we can leverage to help create a roadmap for DoK beginners. 

The secondary purpose of this document is to capture gaps in existing content so we can, as a community, create content to fill those gaps.

## Goals
Provide a set of resources to help guide a complete beginner with the base set of knowledge to start running data workloads on Kubernetes.

We will break the content into sections in a logical order to guide someone from DoK beginner to deploying their first stateful application on kubernetes.
